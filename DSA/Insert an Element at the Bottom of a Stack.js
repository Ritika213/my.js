//You are given a stack st of n integers and an element x. You have to insert x at the bottom of the given stack. 

Note: //Everywhere in this problem, the bottommost element of the stack is shown first while priniting the stack.

//Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
x = 2
st = //{4,3,2,1,8}
Output
{2,4,3,2,1,8}
Explanation
//After insertion of 2, the final stack will be {2,4,3,2,1,8}.
//Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
x = 4
st = //{5,3,1}
Output
{4,5,3,1}
Explanation:
//After insertion of 4, the final stack will be {4,5,3,1}.
 Task:

//don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function insertAtBottom() which takes a stack st and an integer 
//x as inputs and returns the modified stack after insertion.

//Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
//Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
//0 <= x, elements of stack <= 109

class Solution {
    //Function to insert an element at the bottom of a stack.
    insert(st, x) {
        if (st.length === 0) {
            st.push(x);
            return;
        }
        let t = st.pop();
        this.insert(st, x);
        st.push(t);
        return;
    }
    insertAtBottom(st, x) {
        //your code here
         this.insert(st, x);
        return st;
    }
