//given the heads of two non-empty singly linked lists, head1 and head2, that intersect at a certain point. Return that Node where
//  these two linked lists intersect.

Note:// It is guaranteed that the intersected node always exists.

//In the custom input you have to give input for CommonList which pointed at the end of both head1 and head2 to form a Y-shaped linked list.
Examples:

Input: head1:// 10 -> 15 -> 30, head2: 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 15 -> 30
Output: 15
Explanation// From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 15 -> 30, whose starting point is 15.
Input: head1:// 4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5, head2: 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5
Output: 1
Explanation:// From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 1 -> 8 -> 5, whose starting point is 1.
