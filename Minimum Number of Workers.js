//given an array arr[], where arr[i] denotes the range of working hours a person at position i can cover.

//If arr[i] ≠ -1, the person at index i can work and cover the time interval [i - arr[i], i + arr[i]].
//If arr[i] = -1, the person is unavailable and cannot cover any time.
//The task is to find the minimum number of people required to cover the entire working day from 0 to n - 1. If it is
//  not possible to fully cover the day, return -1.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 1, 0]
Output: 1
Explanation:// The person at index 1 can cover the interval [-1, 3]. After adjusting to valid bounds, this becomes [0, 3], which 
//fully covers the entire working day 0 to n -1. Therefore, only 1 person is required to cover the whole day.
Input: arr = [2, 3, 4, -1, 2, 0, 0, -1, 0]
Output: -1
Explanation:// Persons up to index 2 cover interval [0…6], but working hour 7 cannot be cover as arr[7] = -1, Since the 7th hour
// cannot be covered by any person, it is impossible to cover the full working day.
Input: arr= [0, 1, 0, -1]
Output: -1
Explanation:// The last hour cannot be covered by any person, so it is impossible to cover the full working day.
Constraints
//1 ≤ arr.size() ≤105
//-1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.size()
