//Given a number n, generate bit patterns from 0 to 2n-1 such that successive patterns differ by one bit. 
//A Gray code sequence must begin with 0.
 
Examples:
Input: n = 2
Output: ["00", "01", "11", "10"]
Explanation: 
//00 and 01 differ by one bit.
//01 and 11 differ by one bit.
//11 and 10 also differ by one bit.
Input: n = 3
Output: ["000", "001", "011", "010", "110", "111", "101", "100"]
Explanation
//000 and 001 differ by one bit.
//001 and 011 differ by one bit.
//011 and 010 differ by one bit.
//Similarly, every successive pattern 
//differs by one bit.

Constraints 
//1 ≤ n ≤ 16

 * @param {number} n
 * @returns {number[]}
