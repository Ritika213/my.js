//Given an array arr[], where the ith element of arr[] represents the price of a stock on the ith day (all prices are non-negative integers).
//Find the maximum profit you can make by buying and selling stocks such that after selling a stock, you cannot buy again on the next day
//  (i.e.,  there is a one-day cooldown).

Examples:

Input: arr = [0, 2, 1, 2, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation:// You first buy on day 1, sell on day 2 then cool down, then buy on day 4, and sell on day 5. The total profit earned is (2-0) 
//+ (3-2) = 3, which is the maximum achievable profit.
Input:  arr = [3, 1, 6, 1, 2, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation:// You first buy on day 2 and sell on day 3 then cool down, then again you buy on day 5 and then sell on day 6. Clearly, the total
 //profit earned is (6-1) + (4-2) = 7, which is the maximum achievable profit.
Constraint
//1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
//1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104


class Solution {
    maxProfit(arr) {
        
     if (arr === null || arr.length === 0) return 0;

        let hold = -arr[0]; 
        let sold = 0;       
        let rest = 0;       
        for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; ++i) {
            let p = arr[i];

            let newHold = Math.max(hold, rest - p);
            
            

            let newSold = hold + p;
            

            let newRest = Math.max(rest, sold);
            

            hold = newHold;
            sold = newSold;
            rest = newRest;
        }
            return Math.max(sold, rest);
    }
}
