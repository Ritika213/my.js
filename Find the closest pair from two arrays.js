//Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of size n and m and a number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x and the pair has 
// an element from each array. In the case of multiple closest pairs return any one of them.

Note :// In the driver code, the absolute difference between the sum of the closest pair and x is printed.

Examples:

Input : arr1 = [1, 4, 5, 7], arr2= [10, 20, 30, 40], x = 32
Output : [1, 30]
Explanation://The closest pair whose sum is closest to 32 is [1, 30] = 31.
Input : arr1 = [1, 4, 5, 7], arr2 = [10, 20, 30, 40], x = 50 
Output : [7, 40] 
Explanation: //The closest pair whose sum is closest to 50 is [7, 40] = 47.
Constraints
//1 ≤ arr1.size(), arr2.size() ≤ 105
//1 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 109
//1 ≤ x ≤ 109

        let mindiff = Number.MAX_VALUE;

        while (i < arr1.length && j >= 0) {
            let sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j];
            let diff = Math.abs(sum - x);

                mindiff = diff;
                ans = [arr1[i], arr2[j]];
            }
