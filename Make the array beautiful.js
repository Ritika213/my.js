//Given an array of negative and non-negative integers. You need to make the array beautiful.

//An array is beautiful if two adjacent integers, arr[i] and arr[i+1] are either negative or positive. You can do the
//  following operation any number of times until the array becomes beautiful.
//If two adjacent are different i.e. one of them is negative and other is positive, remove them. 
//Return the beautiful array after performing the above operation.
//An empty array is also a beautiful array.
//There can be multiple beautiful output arrays. For consistencty with the test cases, scan the array from left to right
//  for removing two adjacent.
Examples:

Input: arr = [4, 2,-2, 1] 
Output: [4, 1]
Explanation// As at indices 1 and 2 , 2 and -2 have different sign, they are removed. And the the final array is: [4, 1].

Input: arr = [2,-2, -1, 1]
Output: []
Explanation:// As at indices 0 and 1, 2 and -2 have different sign, so they are removed. Now the array is 1 -1.Now 1 and
// -1 are also removed as they have different sign. So the final array is empty. 
Constraints
//1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
//-105 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
