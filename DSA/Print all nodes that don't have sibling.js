//Given a Binary Tree of n nodes, find all the nodes that don't have any siblings. You need to return a list of integers containing 
//all the nodes that don't have a sibling in sorted order (Increasing).

//Two nodes are said to be siblings if they are present at the same level, and their parents are the same.

Note// The root node can not have a sibling so it cannot be included in our answer.

//Example 1:

Input :
       37
      /   
    20
    /     
  113 

Output: 
//20 113
Explanation 
//Nodes 20 and 113 dont have any siblings.

//Example 2:

Input :
      // 1
    //  / \
   //  2   3 

Output: 
-1
Explanation: 
//Every node has a sibling.
Task  
//don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function noSibling() which takes the root of the tree as input parameter and 
//returns a list of integers containing all the nodes that don't have a sibling in sorted order. If all nodes have a sibling, then the 
//returning list should contain only one element -1.

//Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
//Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the tree)

Constraints
//1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 104
