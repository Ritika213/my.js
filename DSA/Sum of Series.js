//Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . . (n terms) 

Examples:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation:// For n = 1, the sum will be 1.
Input: n = 5
Output: 15
Explanation:// For n = 5, sum will be 15. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
//Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
//Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109
