//Given a string s of opening and closing brackets '(' and ')' only, find an equal point in the string. An equal 
// point is a position k (0-based) such that the number of opening brackets before position k is equal to the number
//  of closing brackets from position k to the end of the string. If multiple such points exist, return the first 
// valid position.

//The string can be split at any position from 0 to n, where n is the length of the string.
//If we split at 0, it means there is an empty string on left.
//If we split at n, it means there is an empty string on right.
Examples:

Input: s = "(())))("
Output: 4
//Explanation:

Input : s = "))"
Output: 2
Explanation:// After index 2, the string splits into "))" and an empty string. The number of opening brackets 
//in the first part is 0 and the number of closing brackets in the second part is also 0.
Constraints
//1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 105
