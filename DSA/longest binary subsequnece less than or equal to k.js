//given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

//Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

Note:

//The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
//The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
//A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order 
//of the remaining characters.
 

//Example 1:

Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation// The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal 
//to 2 in decimal.
//Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
//The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.

//Example 2:

Input: s = "00101001", k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation:// "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal
 //to 1 in decimal.
//The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
//s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= k <= 109
