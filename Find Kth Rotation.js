//Given an increasing sorted rotated array arr[] of distinct integers. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.
//Let's suppose we have an array arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 9], if we rotate it by 2 times it will look like this:
//After 1st Rotation : [9, 2, 4, 6]
//After 2nd Rotation : [6, 9, 2, 4]

Examples:

Input: arr = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation:// The given array is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The original sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We can see that the array was 
//rotated 1 times to the right.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 0
Explanation: //The given array is not rotated.
Constraints
//1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
//1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @returns {number}
