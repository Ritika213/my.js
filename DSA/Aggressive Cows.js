//given an array with unique elements of stalls[],which denote the position of a stall. You are also given an integer k which denotes the number 
// of aggressive cows. Your task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

Examples :

Input: stalls = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation //The first cow can be placed at stalls[0], the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and the third cow can be placed at stalls[3]. 
//The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 3, which also is the largest among all possible ways.

Input: stalls = [10, 1, 2, 7, 5], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:// The first cow can be placed at stalls[0],the second cow can be placed at stalls[1] and the third cow can be placed at stalls[4].
//The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 4, which also is the largest among all possible ways.
Input: stalls = [2, 12, 11, 3, 26, 7], k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:// Each cow can be placed in any of the stalls, as the no. of stalls are exactly equal to the number of cows.
//The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 1, which also is the largest among all possible ways.
Constraints:
2 <= stalls.size() <= 106
0 <= stalls[i] <= 108
1 <= k <= stalls.size()
