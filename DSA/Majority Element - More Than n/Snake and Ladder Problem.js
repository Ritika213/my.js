//Given an integer n such that there is n × n Snakes and Ladders board with cells numbered from 1 to n*n, 
// find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach cell n*n starting from cell 1. Given two arrays of even lengths:

//lad, where each pair (lad[2*i], lad[2*i + 1]) represents the start and end of a ladder.
//sn[], where each pair (sn[2*i], sn[2*i + 1]) represents the start and end of a snake.
//If you land on the start cell of a snake or ladder, you must immediately move to its corresponding end cell.

//You have complete control over the outcome of each dice throw i.e., in a single move,  you can move forward by
//  any number of cells from 1 to 6. 

//If it is impossible to reach cell n*n, return -1.

Examples:

//Input: n = 6, lad[] = [3, 22, 5, 8, 11, 35, 20, 32], sn[] = [17, 4, 19, 7, 34, 1, 21, 9]
Output: 3
//Explanation: For the 6 × 6 board, the minimum number of dice throws needed to reach cell 36 from cell 1 is 3.
//One optimal path is:
//Throw 4 to move from 1 to 5, then take the ladder to 8
//Throw 3 to move from 8 to 11, then take the ladder to 35
//Throw 1 to move from 35 to 36
//So the destination is reached in 3 dice throws.

//Input: n = 3, lad[] = [2, 8], sn[] = [7, 3]
Output: 2
//Explanation: For the 3 × 3 board, the minimum number of dice throws needed to reach cell 9 from cell 1 is 2.
//One optimal path is:
//Throw 1 to move from 1 to 2, then take the ladder to 8.
//Throw 1 to move from 8 to 9.
//So the destination is reached in 2 dice throws.
Constraints
//1 ≤ n ≤ 103
//1 ≤ lad.size(), sn.size(), lad[i], sn[i] ≤ n2
