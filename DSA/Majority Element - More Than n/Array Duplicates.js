//Given an array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, and each element appears at most twice, return
// an array of all the integers that appears twice.

Note:// You can return the elements in any order but the driver code will print them in sorted order.

Examples:

Input: arr = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3] 
Explanation:// 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
Input: arr = [3, 1, 2] 
Output: []
Explanation: //There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.
Constraints
//1 ≤ n ≤ 106
//1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n

    findDuplicates(arr) {

            const idx = Math.abs(arr[i]) - 1;
            if (arr[idx] < 0) ans.push(idx + 1);
            else arr[idx] = -arr[idx];
        }
        
        return ans;
