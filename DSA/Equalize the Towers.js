//given an array heights[] representing the heights of towers and another array cost[] where each element represents the cost of modifying
//  the height of respective tower.

//The goal is to make all towers of same height by either adding or removing blocks from each tower.
//Modifying the height of tower (add or remove) 'i' by 1 unit costs cost[i].
//Return the minimum cost to equalize the heights of all towers.

Examples:

Input: heights = [1, 2, 3], cost = [10, 100, 1000]
Output: 120
Explanation:// The heights can be equalized by either "Removing one block from 3 and adding one in 1" or "Adding two blocks in 1 and 
//adding one in 2". Since the cost of operation in tower 3 is 1000, the first process would yield 1010 while the second one yields 120.
Input: heights = [7, 1, 5], cost = [1, 1, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation //The minimum cost to equalize the towers is 6, achieved by setting all towers to height 5.

Constraints
//1 ≤ heights.size() = cost.size() ≤ 105
//1 ≤ heights[i] ≤ 104
//1 ≤ cost[i] ≤ 103
