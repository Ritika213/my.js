//Given a matrix mat[][] of size n × m consisting of 0s and 1s. You start at the top-left cell (0, 0) and
//  initially move in the left-to-right direction (i.e., towards the right).

//While traversing the matrix, follow these rules:

//If the current cell contains 0, continue moving in the same direction.
//If the current cell contains 1, change your direction to the right (clockwise turn), and update the cell value to 0.
//You continue this process until you move outside the boundaries of the matrix. Your task is to determine 
// the coordinates (row and column index) of the cell from which you exit the matrix.
Examples:

Input: mat = [[0, 1, 0],
               [0, 1, 1], 
               [0, 0, 0]]
Output: [1, 0]
Explanation 

//From the image we can see that, enter the matrix at (0, 0) 
//-> then move towards (0, 1) ->  1 is encountered 
//-> turn right towards (1, 1)  -> again 1 is encountered 
//-> turn right again towards (1, 0) 
//-> now, the boundary of matrix will be crossed. Hence, exit point reached at [1, 0].
Input: mat = [[0, 0]]
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: 
//Enter the matrix at cell (0, 0).
//Since the cell contains 0, we continue moving in the same direction.
//We reach cell (0, 1), which also contains a 0. So, we continue moving in the same direction, we exit the matrix
//  from cell [0, 1].
Constraints
//1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100
