//Given a floor of dimensions n × m and an unlimited supply of tiles of size 1 × m, find the total number of ways to
//  completely tile the floor.
//Each tile can be placed in one of the following ways:

//Horizontally, covering 1 row and m columns.
//Vertically, covering m rows and 1 column.
//Count all possible ways to cover the entire floor such that there are no overlaps and no uncovered cells.

//Since the number of possible tilings can be very large, return the answer modulo 109+7.

Note// n and m are positive integers, and m ≥ 2.
Examples:

Input: n = 4, m = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:// There are exactly two valid ways to tile the floor. 

Input: n = 2, m = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:// Placing a tile vertically would require a height of 3, which exceeds the floor's height of 2.
// The only way to cover the entire floor is by placing 2 horizontally, one in each row, resulting in 
// exactly one valid tiling. 
Constraints
//1 ≤ n ≤ 105
//2 ≤ m ≤ 105

 * @param {number} n
