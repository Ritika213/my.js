//given two strings s1 and s2, of equal lengths. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

Note: //A string is a rotation of another if it can be formed by moving characters from the start to the end (or vice versa) 
// without rearranging them.

Examples :

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
Output: true
Explanation:// After 2 right rotations, s1 will become equal to s2.
Input: s1 = "aab", s2 = "aba"
Output: true
Explanation:// After 1 left rotation, s1 will become equal to s2.
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "acbd"
Output: false
Explanation: //Strings are not rotations of each other.
Constraints
//1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 105
//s1, s2 consists of lowercase English alphabets.


class Solution {
    areRotations(s1, s2) {
        
        if (s1.length !== s2.length) return 0;

        let t = s1 + s1;
        let n = s2.length;

        for (let i = 0; i <= t.length - n; i++) {
            if (t.substr(i, n) === s2)
                return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
