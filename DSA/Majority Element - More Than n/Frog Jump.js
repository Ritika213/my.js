//Given an integer array height[] where height[i] represents the height of the i-th stair, a frog starts from the first stair and 
//wants to reach the last stair. From any stair i, the frog has two options: it can either jump to the (i+1)th stair or the (i+2)th 
//stair. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference in height between the two stairs. Determine the minimum total cost required 
//for the frog to reach the last stair.

Example:

Input: heights = [20, 30, 40, 20]
Output: 20
Explanation://  Minimum cost is incurred when the frog jumps from stair 0 to 1 then 1 to 3:
//jump from stair 0 to 1: cost = |30 - 20| = 10
//jump from stair 1 to 3: cost = |20 - 30| = 10
//Total Cost = 10 + 10 = 20
Input: heights = [30, 20, 50, 10, 40]
Output: 30
Explanation// Minimum cost will be incurred when frog jumps from stair 0 to 2 then 2 to 4:
//jump from stair 0 to 2: cost = |50 - 30| = 20
//jump from stair 2 to 4: cost = |40 - 50| = 10
//Total Cost = 20 + 10 = 30

Constraints
//1 ≤ height.size() ≤ 105
//0 ≤ height[i] ≤ 104


class Solution {
    minCost(height) {
        
        let n = height.length;
        if (n === 1) return 0;
        
        let prev2 = 0; // cost to reach i-2
        let prev1 = Math.abs(height[1] - height[0]); // cost to reach i-1

        for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            let jumpOne = prev1 + Math.abs(height[i] - height[i - 1]);
            let jumpTwo = prev2 + Math.abs(height[i] - height[i - 2]);
            let curr = Math.min(jumpOne, jumpTwo);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        return prev1;
    }
