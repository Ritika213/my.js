//A Techfest is underway, and each participant is given a ticket with a unique number. Organizers decide to award prize points to everyone who has 
//a ticket ID between a and b (inclusive). The points given to a participant with ticket number x will be the sum of powers of the prime factors of 
//x.

//For instance, if points are to be awarded to a participant with ticket number 12, the amount of points given out will be equal to the sum of 
//powers in the prime factorization of 12 (22 Ã— 31), which will be 2 + 1 = 3.

//Given a and b, determine the sum of all the points that will be awarded to the participants with ticket numbers between a and b (inclusive)

Input: 
a = 9
b = 12
Output: 
8
Explanation 
//For 9, prime factorization is:32 
//So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
//For 10, prime factorization is : 21x51 
//So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
//For 11, prime factorization is : 111 
//So, sum of the powers of primes is: 1
//For 12, prime factorization is : 22x 31 
//So, sum of powers of primes is: 3
//Therefore the total sum is 2+2+1+3=8.
