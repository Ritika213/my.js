//Given an integer array arr[], find the minimum possible product that can be obtained by multiplying the elements 
// of any non-empty subset of the array.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 1
Explanation:// The possible subset products are 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 6, and 6. The minimum product is 1, obtained by
// selecting the subset [1].
Input: arr = [4, -2, 5]
Output: -40
Explanation: //The minimum product is -40, obtained by selecting the subset [4, -2, 5].

Constraints

//1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10
//-10 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10

    minProd(arr) {
        
        let ans = Infinity;

        let n = arr.length;

        for (let mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {

                    prod *= arr[i];
                }
            }

            ans = Math.min(ans, prod);
