//Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum difference between an ancestor node A and its descendant
//  node B, i.e., maximize A - B.

Examples :

Input: root = [5, 2, 1] 

Output: 4
Explanation //The maximum difference we can get is 4, which is between 5 and 1.
Input: root = [1, 2, 3, N, N, N, 7] 

Output: -1
Explanation: //The maximum difference we can get is -1, which is between 1 and 2.
Constraints

//2 ≤ no. of nodes in root ≤ 104
//0 ≤ root.node->data ≤ 105
//2 ≤ Number of edges ≤ 104
