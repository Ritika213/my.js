//given an undirected network of V hospitals numbered from 0 to V - 1, represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each element edges[i] =
//  [u, v] denotes a direct connection between hospital u and hospital v.
//In one operation, you are allowed to remove any existing link and reconnect it between two hospitals that are currently not directly or
//  indirectly connected.

//task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make sure that all hospitals become connected, either directly or 
// indirectly, using the given links.


Note:// If it is impossible to connect all hospitals into a single network, return -1.

Examples:

Input: V = 4, E = 3, edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]]
Output: 1
Explanation// Remove the connection between hospitals 1 and 2 and connect the hospitals 1 and 3.

Input: V = 5, E = 4, edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
Output: 0
Explanation:// All hospitals are already connected directly or indirectly. No rearrangement of connections is required.

Constraints
//1 ≤ V ≤ 103
//0 ≤ E ≤ V*(V-1)/2
//0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < V
