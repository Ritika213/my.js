//Given an array arr[], find any subsequence of three elements such that, arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] and (i < j < k).

//If such a subsequence exists, return the three elements as an array. Otherwise, return an empty array.

Note

//The driver code will print 1 if the returned subsequence is valid and present in the array.
//The driver code will print 0 if no such subsequence exists.
//If the returned subsequence does not satisfy the required format or conditions, the output will be -1.
//Examples :

Input: arr = [12, 11, 10, 5, 6, 2, 30]
Output: 1
Explanation:// As 5 < 6 < 30, and they  appear in the same sequence in the array. So output is 1.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1 
Explanation:// As the array is sorted, for every i, j, k, where i < j < k, arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k].So output is 1.
Input: arr = [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation:// No such Subsequence exist, so empty array is returned (the driver code automatically prints 0 in this case).
Constraints
//1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
//1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
